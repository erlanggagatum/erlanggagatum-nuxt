_A brief intro about Gatum Erlangga_

![About](img/intro-meme.jpg)

Hi everyone :)

Welcome to my website! ðŸŽ‰

My name is Gatum Erlangga, a software developer and tech enthusiast from Indonesia!

I started my study in 2017 at University of Surabaya (UBAYA), majoring Informatics Engineering. Over the years, I have built many school projects, started from simple game project, huffman code for data structure project, advanced finance record web application, machine learning application: sentiment analysis, and recently have built academic information system as my freelance project.

Personally, I interested in software development. However, I'd like to continue my study to learn more about AI and its application in real world, especially Indonesia.

Since the publication of National Strategic of Artificial Intelligence in Indonesia, my interest in AI has rapidly grown. Indonesia has many potential areas to implement AI, which healthcare is one of it. Can you imagine billions of people can be saved by using AI? Early diagnose system made by AI can be use as the physician's consideration to determine the best medication!

From this reason, I motivated to continue my study abroad! 

## Let's work together!

Do you want to collaborate? Or do you have any cool project idea to build?

Feel free to contact me!
